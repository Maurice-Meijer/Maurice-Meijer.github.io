            <div class='par'>
                After doing some research on the topic 'Motivation' I came across <br>
                a few notable sources that helped me form my conclusion on what motivation <br>
                is. I believe that we get motivated once the pain of not doing something <br>
                becomes greater than the pain of actually doing it. <br>

                <br>

                However, there is a big misconseption about motivation. <br>
                "Motivation is often the result of action, not the cause of it. <br>
                Getting started, even in very small ways, is a form of active inspiration <br>
                that naturally produces momentum" (Clear, 2012). <br>

                <br>

                After doing some more digging I found out that there are <br>
                two main forms of motivation, internal and external. <br>
                Internal motivation according to Marinoff (2020) "[Is] when you do <br>
                something because it's internally fulfilling, interesting or <br>
                enjoyable-without an expectation of a reward or recognition from others." <br>

                <br>

                On the other hand, external motivation is motivation <br>
                fueled from surrounding inputs in your life, like your family, <br>
                friends, school etc. These inputs can be both positive and negative. <br>
                If your boss would give you a raise this would be positive. <br>
                However, if your family tells you that you need to lose weight, <br>
                that would be a negative input. Although, this would still <br>
                motivate you to take action. <br>
