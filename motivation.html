<h1 class='title'>Motivation</h1>

        <h2 class='header'>Theory</h2>
            <div class='par'>
                After doing some research on the topic 'Motivation' I came across <br>
                a few notable sources that helped me form my conclusion on what motivation <br>
                is. I believe that we get motivated once the pain of not doing something <br>
                becomes greater than the pain of actually doing it. <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                However, there is a big misconseption about motivation. <br>
                "Motivation is often the result of action, not the cause of it. <br>
                Getting started, even in very small ways, is a form of active inspiration <br>
                that naturally produces momentum" (Clear, 2012). <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                After doing some more digging I found out that there are <br>
                two main forms of motivation, internal and external. <br>
                Internal motivation according to Marinoff (2020) "[Is] when you do <br>
                something because it's internally fulfilling, interesting or <br>
                enjoyable-without an expectation of a reward or recognition from others." <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                On the other hand, external motivation is motivation <br>
                fueled from surrounding inputs in your life, like your family, <br>
                friends, school etc. These inputs can be both positive and negative. <br>
                If your boss would give you a raise this would be positive. <br>
                However, if your family tells you that you need to lose weight, <br>
                that would be a negative input. Although, this would still <br>
                motivate you to take action. <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                After watching Dan Pink's Ted Talk I was surprised to <br>
                find out that motivation doesn't work the way you think it <br>
                does. He spoke about how external motivation works amazing <br>
                but takes away the creative process in people. He explained <br>
                this by using The Candle Problem. It showed that people who <br>
                were given a reward were slower at solving a creative problem <br>
                in oppose to the people who didn't recieve a reward. <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                This study caused a lot of confusion and reconsidiration. <br>
                Dan spoke about companies who got rid of their external motivation <br>
                and began to help employees with their internal motivation. <br>
                Dan spoke about a company that gives their employees 24 hours <br>
                to create whatever they want, as long as it has nothing to do <br>
                with their current tasks. This showed a greater productivity, <br>
                efficienty and happiness in the employees.

                "Je bent in redelijke mate intrinsiek gemotiveerd en in redelijke mate <br>
                extrinsiek gemotiveerd. Dat je redelijk intrinsiek gemotiveerd bent <br>
                betekent dat je het best leuk vindt om te studeren. Maar heel leuk <br>
                vind je het nou ook weer niet. Dat je in redelijke mate extrinsiek <br>
                gemotiveerd bent wil zeggen dat je er ook rekening mee houdt wat je <br>
                met je studie kunt bereiken: een diploma, geld, status of de erkenning <br>
                van de mensen waar je van houdt. Op zich is er niks mis met jouw motivatie. <br> 
                WÃ©l zou je gelukkiger zijn als je studie wat beter zou passen bij je <br>
                werkelijke interesses." (123test.nl) <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                I agree with the results of 123test, I am motivated because I know <br>
                that I will need to study for a job but I wouldn't mind to study <br>
                less. It's not like I love to go to school. <br>
