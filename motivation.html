            <div class='par'>
                After doing some research on the topic 'Motivation' I came across <br>
                a few notable sources that helped me form my conclusion on what motivation <br>
                is. I believe that we get motivated once the pain of not doing something <br>
                becomes greater than the pain of actually doing it. <br>

                <br>

                However, there is a big misconseption about motivation. <br>
                "Motivation is often the result of action, not the cause of it. <br>
                Getting started, even in very small ways, is a form of active inspiration <br>
                that naturally produces momentum" (Clear, 2012). <br>

                After doing some more digging I found out that there are <br>
                two main forms of motivation, internal and external. <br>
                According to Marinoff (2020) "when you do something because <br>
                it’s internally fulfilling, interesting or enjoyable—without <br>
                an expectation of a reward or recognition from others." <br>
