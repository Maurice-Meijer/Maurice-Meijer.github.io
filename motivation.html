            <div class='par'>
                After doing some research on the topic 'Motivation' I came across <br>
                a few notable sources that helped me form my conclusion on what motivation <br>
                is. I believe that we get motivated once the pain of not doing something <br>
                becomes greater than the pain of actually doing it. <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                However, there is a big misconseption about motivation. <br>
                "Motivation is often the result of action, not the cause of it. <br>
                Getting started, even in very small ways, is a form of active inspiration <br>
                that naturally produces momentum" (Clear, 2012). <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                After doing some more digging I found out that there are <br>
                two main forms of motivation, internal and external. <br>
                Internal motivation according to Marinoff (2020) "[Is] when you do <br>
                something because it's internally fulfilling, interesting or <br>
                enjoyable-without an expectation of a reward or recognition from others." <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                On the other hand, external motivation is motivation <br>
                fueled from surrounding inputs in your life, like your family, <br>
                friends, school etc. These inputs can be both positive and negative. <br>
                If your boss would give you a raise this would be positive. <br>
                However, if your family tells you that you need to lose weight, <br>
                that would be a negative input. Although, this would still <br>
                motivate you to take action. <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                After watching Dan Pink's Ted Talk I was surprised to <br>
                find out that motivation doesn't work the way you think it <br>
                does. He spoke about how external motivation works amazing <br>
                but takes away the creative process in people. He explained <br>
                this by using The Candle Problem. It showed that people who <br>
                were given a reward were slower at solving a creative problem <br>
                in oppose to the people who didn't recieve a reward. <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                This study caused a lot of confusion and reconsidiration. <br>
                Dan spoke about companies who got rid of their external motivation <br>
                and began to help employees with their internal motivation. <br>
                Dan spoke about a company that gives their employees 24 hours <br>
                to create whatever they want, as long as it has nothing to do <br>
                with their current tasks. This showed a greater productivity, <br>
                efficienty and happiness in the employees.

                vind je het nou ook weer niet. Dat je in redelijke mate extrinsiek <br>

                met je studie kunt bereiken: een diploma, geld, status of de erkenning <br>
                van de mensen waar je van houdt. Op zich is er niks mis met jouw motivatie. <br> 
                Wel zou je gelukkiger zijn als je studie wat beter zou passen bij je <br>
                werkelijke interesses." (123test.nl) <br>

                <br>
                <br>

                I agree with the results of 123test, I am motivated because I know <br>
                that I will need to study for a job but I wouldn't mind to study <br>
                less. It's not like I love to go to school. <br>

                Independence(21 points) <br>
                The ancor point that I scored the highest on was independence. I value <br>
                independence a lot, because I love to be in charge of my own life. <br>
                When i'm free of anything I can do whatever I want so I don't feel forced <br>
                to do certain jobs. <br>

                Norms and Values(15 points) <br>
                I think that the reason that I scored this high on norms and values <br>
                is that I care about the future of the world. Obviously I want to live <br>
                a nice life but I also want to do something for the next generation. <br>

                Social Contacts(6 points) <br>
                The ancor point that I scored the lowest on was social contacts. <br>
                The reason for this is that I care about having people around but <br>
                not just because they are business related. I want to have a good <br>
                time with them too. <br>

                I don't feel very motivated because after sitting at home for over <br>
                6 months I now have to start back up again. I get distracted pretty fast <br>
                because i simply don't feel like doing anything... <br>

                "I know Maurice has a hard time focussing on work like me, we've been <br>
                sitting at home for the past 6 months so I understand that it's hard to <br>
                start back up again" (Ben Ryder)
