                which I think gets at the core of motivation. To paraphrase Pressfield,
                “At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it.”
            -->
            After doing some research on the topic 'Motivation' I came across <br>
            a few notable sources that helped me form my conclusion on what motivation <br>
            is. I believe that we get motivated once the pain of not doing something <br>
            becomes greater than the pain of actually doing it. <br>

            <br>

            However, there is a big misconseption about motivation. <br>
            "Motivation is often the result of action, not the cause of it. <br>
            Getting started, even in very small ways, is a form of active inspiration <br>
            that naturally produces momentum" (Clear, 2012). <br>
