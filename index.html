        <h3>HBO</h3>
        The HBO level suits me because before this i've done Havo-TTO <br>
        at Jacob van Liesveldt in Hellevoetsluis. So I think this would <br>
        be the next step towards my future. <br>

        <h3>ICT</h3>
        The study programme suits me because I've always been interested <br>
        in computers and how they work. I'm fluent in english so that's <br>
        why I wouldn't have any problems understanding the study. <br>
