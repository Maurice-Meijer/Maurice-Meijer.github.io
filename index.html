        <h3>HBO</h3>
        The HBO level suits me because before this i've done Havo-TTO 
        at Jacob van Liesveldt in Hellevoetsluis. So I think this would 
        be the next step towards my future.

        <h3>ICT</h3>
        The study programme suits me because I've always been interested
        in computers and how they work. I'm fluent in english so that's
        why I wouldn't have any problems understanding the study.
